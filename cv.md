## *About Me*
My name means "revived"*(др.-греч. ἀνάστασις)*, so I'm trying to get my life back by doing different things, I've been interested in studying computer technology for a long time, so I'am finally taking a full course from rs-school. I'm ready for difficulties, but my resources are limited :)  

## *Skills*
Stepping into Git 
 and Visual Studio Code

## *Code Example*

```
 <script>
    alert( 'Привет, мир!' );
  </script>
  ```
